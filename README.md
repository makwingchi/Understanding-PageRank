# Understanding-PageRank

### Description
In this analysis, I will understand and analyze graphs, first using some basic NetworkX packages and then by implementing matrix-based PageRank.

After calculating PageRank for a large graph, I will explore how PageRank is affected by adding and deleting certain links in the graph and will gain insight into connectivity.

### Required Libraries
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `urllib`
- `io`
- `gzip`

### Result
The analysis is detailed in [this notebook](https://github.com/makwingchi/Understanding-PageRank/blob/master/notebook2.ipynb).
